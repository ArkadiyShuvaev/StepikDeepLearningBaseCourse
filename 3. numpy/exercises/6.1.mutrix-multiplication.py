# Matrix multiplication
# Write two functions that each multiply two square matrices, one without using the built-in numpy functions and the other --- using numpy. The first problem is inputted with lists of size, each with size elements. The second task is fed with objects of type np.ndarray --- square matrices of the same size.

# The first function should return a list of lists and the second function should return np.array.

import numpy as np

    param second: list of "size" lists, each contains "size" floats
